# ENHANCING-OPERATIONAL-PROCESSES-AT-ESNAD-COMPANY
Esnad factory faced many problems in their inventory process due to poor forecasting. The objective of this project is trying to solve the main problem, which is the demand forecasting results by using different types of forecasting methods. The developing team used more than five methods of forecasting to overcome the problem. The data collected from the management were analyzed, and then the forecasting methods were applied and interpreted. The findings show that the best forecasting method is seasonality without trend and this method gives the most accurate results in comparison with the other methods. Game theory is also one of the tools used in this project. The documentation of the procedures will make a big difference in the factory running.
